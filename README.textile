h1. FIFO

FIFO is queueing library built on top of Amazon Simple Queue Service. Like DelayedJob it encapsulates the common pattern of executing time consuming tasks in the background but unlike DelayedJob it can be used without a database.

h3. Features

* Built on Amazon's reliable and scalable queue service.
* Communicate between different disjoint parts of a complex application.
* Use multiple queues without any initial connection overhead.
* Doesn't poll the database.
* ActiveRecord objects maintain state through the queue.
* Retry mechanism.

h2. Usage

Setup Amazon access id and secret.

<pre>
FIFO::QueueManager.setup AWS_ACCESS_ID, AWS_SECRET_KEY
</pre>

Create a queue object. The connection to SQS is lazily opened thus preventing any delay at the start of your application.

For Rails, this can be added to a file in "config/initializers/".  Additionally, queue names can include the current Rails environment name for modularity.

<pre>
queue = FIFO::Queue.new QUEUE_NAME
</pre>
